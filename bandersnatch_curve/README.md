# Bandersnatch Curve  

The bandersnatch curve is based on the scalar field of BLS12-381 curve[https://github.com/arithmic/field_trait/tree/main/bls381/src]. The bandersnatch curve is defined by the equation : 
$\ E(F_p) : y^2 = x^3 -3763200000 * x  - 78675968000000$.

The key features of our implementation of the bandersnatch curve : 
* The order of the curve is "1CFB69D4CA675F520CCE760202687600FF8F87007419047174FD06B52876E7E1".
* The generator of the curve is G =  ("0A76451786F95A802C0982BBD0ABD68E41B92ADC86C8859B4F44679B21658710", <br>
"44D150C8B4BD14F79720D021A839E7B7EB4EE43844B30243126A72AC2375490A").
